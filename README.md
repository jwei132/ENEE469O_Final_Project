# ENEE469O_Final_Project

This is the GitHub for our final project in ENEE469O.

We will be attempting to recreate the results from this other GitHub [here](https://github.com/Sambonic/transportation-cost-minimization).

We will be using python since it has free libraries for implementing nearly all matlab functions.
