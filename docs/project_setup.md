# Project Layout

To run this project, download this github repository locally and make a virtual environment in the same project directory to run python scripts.

## Initiating a Virtual Environment

We are using python version 3.11. Please make sure this version is installed with ```which python``` on bash (sorry I don't know windows).

Once the version is verified, you can make a virtual environment with ```python -m venv .venv```. This creates a virtual environment in the current directory named ".venv".

Then after you source the virtual environment (```source ./.venv/bin/activate```), install python dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
